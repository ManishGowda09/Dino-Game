# Dino-Game
🦖 Dino-Game

A simple endless runner game inspired by the Chrome Dino game, built with Python and Pygame.
Jump over obstacles, survive as long as you can, and beat your high score!

🎮 Features

Dino character that jumps with the SPACE key

Scrolling ground for a running effect

Cactus obstacles that spawn and move faster over time

Score counter (earn 1 point per cactus avoided)

Game states: Start screen → Game → Game Over screen

Sprite support: If you add your own Dino and cactus images (dino.png, cactus.png), the game will use them; otherwise, it falls back to colored rectangles.

🖥️ Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Install Pygame:

pip install pygame


Clone this repo or copy the dino_astro.py file and your sprites into a folder.

▶️ How to Play

Run the game:

python dino_astro.py


Controls:

SPACE → Start the game / Jump / Restart after game over

Avoid hitting the cactus to keep scoring!

🖼️ Assets

Place these files in the same folder as the code:

dino.png → Your Dino sprite (~60×60 pixels, transparent background)

cactus.png → Cactus obstacle (~40×60 pixels)

Don’t have sprites? No problem — the game will use rectangles as placeholders.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add day/night cycle with background changes (sky, moon, stars 🌙)

Add clouds and scenery

Add high score saving across sessions

Add sound effects (jump, crash, score)
